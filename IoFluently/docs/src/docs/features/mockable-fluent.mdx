title: Mockable and Fluent API
---

This syntax is pleasant to read and write:

```csharp
(repositoryRoot / "readme.md").CreateFile();
```

The problem is if we want to unit test this code, we don't want the code to actually create a file. We just want to pretend it created the file.

The typical way of solving this problem is to create something like an `IFileService`, which lets you write:

```csharp
_fileService.CreateFile(Path.Combine(repositoryRoot, "readme.md"));
```

The problem with this approach is that it isn't as fluent as the first example.

IoFluently is the best of both worlds. I/O code written with IoFluently is unit testable because all the functionality is implemented in `IIoService`, which is a mockable interface. But you can also write fluent I/O code because every `AbsolutePath` object has an `IoService` property on it, and there are extension methods for every method in `IIoService` that takes an `AbsolutePath`; these extension methods make it so that instead of writing this:

```csharp
var relativePath = absolutePath.IoService.RelativeTo(absolutePath, programFilesPath);
```

You can write this:

```csharp
var relativePath = absolutePath.RelativeTo(programFilesPath);
```

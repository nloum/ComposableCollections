IoFluently is a .NET Standard class library for dealing with files and folders. The API is straightforward and dependency injectable.

Here's what it looks like:

```csharp
var ioService = new IoService();
var readme = (ioService.CurrentDirectory / "docs" / "readme.md").AsSmallTextFile();
var text = readme.Read();
Console.WriteLine(text);
```

I/O-heavy code is much more straightforward when it's written with IoFluently. In addition, IoFluently has a lot of new features not found in standard .NET APIs:

- [Object-oriented file API](/features/object-oriented-files)
- [Cross-platform file change monitoring](/features/monitoring-for-changes)
- [An API that is both mockable and fluent, great for unit testing](/features/mockable-fluent)
- [An in-memory implementation of the filesystem, great for unit testing](/features/in-memory)

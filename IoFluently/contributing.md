# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can open bugs, ask questions (by opening an issue), write documentation, or work on the code itself.

When contributing, please follow this checklist:

1. Create an issue first so that we can make sure we're on the same page, so that everybody's time is spent efficiently.
2. After the discussion, fork the repo and make your changes in the `develop` branch. When your changes are ready to be shared, create a PR back into the `develop` branch of this repo.
3.

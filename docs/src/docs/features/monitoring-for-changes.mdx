title: Monitoring for changes
---

IoFluently provides a powerful API for monitoring files and folders for changes. This API works seamlessly across Mac OS, Windows, and Linux.

Here is code that efficiently creates an observable set of Markdown files:

```csharp
var markdownFiles = documentationFolder.Descendants()
    .ToLiveLinq()
    .Where(x => x.HasExtension(".md") && x.GetPathType() == PathType.File);
```

The lambda in the `.Where` clause gets called once for each new file that is added to the path `documentationFolder` or one of its subdirectories.

IoFluently provides an API for converting paths into strongly-typed objects that know how to read from and write to those paths.

Here is code that enumerates a directory (but not its subdirectories), finds all Markdown files, and converts those `AbsolutePath` objects into strongly-typed objects that know the path is a text file.

```csharp
var markdownChildFiles = documentationFolder.Children()
    .Where(child => child.IsFile() && child.HasExtension(".md"))
    .Select(child => child.AsMarkdownFile());
```

This creates a lazy `IEnumerable` of `IPathWithKnownFormatSync<string>` objects, which can be used like this:

```csharp
IPathWithKnownFormatSync<string> markdownFile = ...;
string markdown = markdownFile.Read();
markdown = markdown + "\n---\n";
markdownFile.Write(markdown);
```

Creating new file formats is easy:

```csharp
public static class Extensions
{
    public static IPathWithKnownFormatSync<string> AsMarkdownFile(this AbsolutePath path)
    {
        return path.AsPathFormat(absPath => absPath.ReadAllText(), (absPath, text) => absPath.WriteAllText(text));
    }
}
```

There are `Task`-oriented variations of this API that work asynchronously.

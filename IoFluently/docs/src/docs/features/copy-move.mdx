title: Copy/move APIs

IoFluently makes it easy to copy or move files in a very natural way. Here's an example of a program that copies everything from the `packages` folder to the `new-packages` folder (but not if there's a more recent version of a file in the destination):

```csharp
var repositoryRoot = service.CurrentDirectory.Ancestors().First(ancestor => (ancestor / ".git").Exists());

var source = repositoryRoot / "packages";
var destination = repositoryRoot / "new-packages";

foreach (var sourceAndDestination in source.Translate(destination))
{
    // Each sourceAndDestination represents a single source / destination pair.
    if (sourceAndDestination.Source.LastWriteTime() > sourceAndDestination.Destination.LastWriteTime())
    {
        sourceAndDestination.Copy(overwrite: true);
    }
}
```

Because the copy operation consists of a loop, you can easily change the behavior depending on arbitrary behaviors that the developer can define.

title: In-memory implementation
---

Any code that uses IoFluently requires minimal modification to run against an in-memory, virtual implementation of `IoService`. To do this, just use the `InMemoryIoService` class. For example:

```csharp
var ioService = new InMemoryIoService(Environment.NewLine, PathFlags.CaseSensitive);
```
